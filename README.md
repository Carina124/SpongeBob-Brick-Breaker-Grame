There is havoc happening in Bikini Bottom! Spongebob must defend his home, the pineapple, against the evil squids that are trying to take over his house! The objective of the game is to move the shell paddle from left to right in order to propel SpongeBob to destroy the big and small evil squids. The big squid needs to be hit three times and the small squid needs to be hit one time. The squids are smart because they are hiding behind bricks which makes it hard for SpongeBob to reach them. Not to worry because Gary the snail is on his way to help SpongeBob protect their home! Gary is a powerup that SpongeBob can get when he destroys the block with two stars on it. Gary is able to destroy all the blocks and squids with only one touch! Sponge pop has only three lives, but he can get more but hitting the blocks that have a heart on them. The longer you hit SpongeBob with the paddle the faster he goes! The way you move on the next level is by destroying all of the squids.
